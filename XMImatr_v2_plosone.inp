* parameters in order of appearence
*
* sw_slopes:		switch for analysis of slopes (0: original signals are analyzed, 1: first temporal derivative is analyzed)
* neighbors:		cross-correlation only if ==0, otherwise in addition mutual information using k nearest neighbors if ==k>0
* T_surr:		length of time window for surrogates, must be 2^n
* T:			length of time window for C-matrix,   must be 2^n
* N_ens:		ensemble size
* N_surr:		number of surrogates
* step_surr:		step width for evaluation
* tstart:		start for analysis
* tstop:		stop  for analysis
* siglev:		level of significance
* sw_corr:		switch for correction (uncorr. if ==0, FWER if ==1, FDR if ==2, Bonferroni if ==3)
* sw_time_out:		output of time as leading column if ==1
